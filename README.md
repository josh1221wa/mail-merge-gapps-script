# mail-merge-gapps-script

Is a script made on Google Apps Script that can get responses from a Google form and send a personalized mail based on the data entered.
The script also has a FormTrigger function that is used to create trigger for the script so that it executes as soon as someone fills in the form.
It also has a feedback system so that mails wonâ€™t be sent to the same entry multiple times.

You can test it out on https://forms.gle/gqkaF7rA4guw5qaE8. Please check your mail after you fill in the form.
